# FTL modding: Join and Sort nameLists
For use with FTL: Faster Than Light.

Joins all the nameLists in a names.xml-type file into one list, sorts the list alphabetically, and then spits out two identical nameLists, one male and one female. I went with the nameLists being the same because well, why must name be gender-specific?

***Additional Notes***

If you want the nameLists separated, uncomment the commented out stuff in the function, xmlize, and comment the stuff below it. It'd certainly be better if this was built into the program, but for now that's how it is.
