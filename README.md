# FTL modding: Join and Sort nameLists
For use with FTL: Faster Than Light.

Joins all the nameLists in a names.xml-type file into one list, sorts the list alphabetically, and then spits out two identical nameLists, one male and one female. I went with the nameLists being the same because well, why must name be gender-specific?

***Additional Notes***

To be added: an option to 'split' the nameLists up.
